# irregularity

# So What is the irregularity? 

# It's the simple program, writen to make my life a little easier 
# The program finds irregular verbs

# I'm learning English now 
# And I don’t want to open the list every time on the Internet and look for irregular verbs, and I decided to write this program 
# How is it work? 
# Just type stack exec irregularity-exe and follow the instruction

# e.g    stack exec irregularity-exe 
#        leave 
#        and you will get:    Got it!  PastSimple:   left    PastParticiple:    left 

# I’ll say right away, that not all irregular verbs are here, but only a “small list”, that is, the most frequently used!
