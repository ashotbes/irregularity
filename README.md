# irregularity

### So What is the irregularity? 

It's a simple program, written to make my life a little easier by finding irregular verbs.

I'm learning English now, 
and I don’t want to open the list every time on the internet and look for irregular verbs, and I decided to write this program.
### How is it work? 
Just type 
```shell
stack exec irregularity-exe
```
and follow the instruction.
e.g    
```shell
stack exec irregularity-exe 
```
```shell
leave
``` 
and you will get:  
```shell
Got it!  PastSimple:   left    PastParticiple:    left 
```

> I’ll say right away, that not all irregular verbs are here, but only a “small list”, of the most frequently used ones!
